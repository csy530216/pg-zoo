# Experiments for PG-ZOO algorithms

Code (in Python 3) for the paper [On the Convergence of Prior-Guided
Zeroth-Order Optimization Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10110) to be
appeared in NeurIPS 2021.

## Numerical benchmarks
The `numerical_benchmarks` folder contains the code for experiments in Section
5.1 in the paper. The code is tested under `numpy==1.18.0, matplotlib==3.1.2`
with Python 3.7.

### Reproducing Figure 1
Please run the following commands:
```bash
mkdir exp_pert
python exp_pert.py
python plot_exp_pert.py
```
**Note:** `bias.npy` corresponds to the vector *b* mentioned in Section D.1.1 in the appendix, which was generated by `generate_bias.py` (and you will obtain a different `bias.npy` if you rerun it).

### Reproducing Figure 2
Please run the following commands:
```bash
mkdir exp
python exp.py
python plot_exp.py
```

## Black-box adversarial attacks
The `adversarial_attacks` folder contains the code for experiments in Section
5.2 in the paper. The code is tested under `torch==1.3.0, torchvision==0.4.1,
numpy==1.17.3` with Python 3.7.

To reproduce the results in Table 1, for RGF methods, run
```bash
python rgf.py --lr {LEARNING_RATE}
```
For History-PRGF methods, run
```bash
python rgf.py --lr {LEARNING_RATE} --prior
```
For ARS methods, run
```bash
python ars.py --lr {LEARNING_RATE}
```
For History-PARS methods, run
```bash
python ars.py --lr {LEARNING_RATE} --prior
```

The model 'mnist_cnn.pt' is obtained from `train.py`.
